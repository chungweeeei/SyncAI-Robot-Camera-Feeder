# The in-container half of .github/workflows/ci.yml: the commands from CLAUDE.md, run against a
# colcon workspace at /workspace with this repo at /workspace/src/syncai_camera_feeder.
#
# It runs under the image's entrypoint, which has already sourced ROS 2 and the ros2_rust underlay.
# It can also be run by hand inside the Dev Container to reproduce CI exactly:
#
#   bash /workspace/src/syncai_camera_feeder/.github/scripts/ci.sh

# --base-paths src so colcon only ever crawls the source tree: colcon-cargo treats every
# Cargo.toml as a package, so anything else that lands under /workspace (a cargo registry, a
# target directory without COLCON_IGNORE) would otherwise be picked up too. console_cohesion
# prints each package's full output once it ends, so a compiler error is readable in the log
# instead of interleaved.
colcon build --base-paths src --symlink-install --event-handlers console_cohesion+

# The overlay generates /workspace/.cargo/config.toml (colcon-ros-cargo), which cargo needs when it
# runs outside colcon. The ROS setup scripts reference unset variables, so -u is lifted around them.

# -D warnings reaches only this crate: cargo passes the trailing arguments to the primary package
